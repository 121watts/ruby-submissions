### [Project Title] NEW IDEA

FOODER

#### Pitch

like UBER but for food DONATIONS.  

#### Description

up to 50% of the food in this country never gets eaten.  what if we created
a sharing economy app that allowed me to give away
food that I'm not going to eat.  Before going on a trip and rather than let my
pantry spoil I could put my food up on FOODER and allow people who want my food
come and get it.  

#### Target Audience

Everyone who eats.  

#### Integrations

Facebook

### [Project Title]

End of Poverty?

#### Pitch

Site that visualizes and tracks world census data of GDP, Poverty, Income, and
life expectancy.

It will pull world census data for wealth generation and see if there is a
correlation between the generation of global wealth and poverty.  Should
the trend appear downwards, estimate the end of global (or a specific countries)
poverty.
