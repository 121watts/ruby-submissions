### [Project Title]

End of Poverty?

#### Pitch

Site that visualizes and tracks world census data of GDP, Poverty, Income, and
life expectancy.  

#### Description

It will pull world census data for wealth generation and see if there is a
correlation between the generation of global wealth and poverty.  Should
the trend appear downwards, estimate the end of global (or a specific countries)
poverty.

#### Target Audience

Idealists who think the world can get better.

Pessimists who think that the world cant.

#### Integrations

Probably facebook or twitter.  
I would use world bank data and API for global GDP and Poverty metrics
