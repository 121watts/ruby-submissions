NYC Open Data

LameSpace

nyc has a list of complaints by building since 2010.  
create an app that allows the user to type an address and find out how many
complaints that building has had, what type, and whether it has been resolved
(all this data is in NYC open data).

additionally, create a map view of all the hotspots of buildings and their complains.  
buildings with no complaints would not be colored and buildings with one complaint
would start with an opaque red and get redder and redder as the complaints increased.

allow user to enter email to notify them if the building they are in has any reported complaints.
